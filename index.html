      <p>
       Bajadena’s forces crossed into Arway and tore our city apart. They marched in, dragged people from their homes and forced them to live under a rule built on fear. Families were split, markets fell silent and the streets that once buzzed with life now echo with the footsteps of occupying soldiers. This is not just about land. This is about people, memories and the right to live free in Arway.

Clans across the region answered the call. From small crews to long-standing houses, clanners stepped forward to protect neighborhoods and rescue those taken. Clan leaders organized safe routes, set watch shifts and ran supply lines. Scouts moved quietly to gather information. Builders and medics opened safe houses for families and fighters. Everyone did their part to keep people safe and to hold our community together.

When clans met Bajadena’s forces they fought with purpose and discipline. They trained together, shared tactics and covered each other’s backs. Old rivalries were put aside because Arway was bigger than any single group. New alliances formed in the squares and on the streets. Together clanners reclaimed checkpoints, freed captured citizens and reopened markets. Each rescue brought hope and strengthened our resolve.

We also fought smart. Plans were made, signals agreed and help sent where it was needed most. Clanners kept lines of communication open, supported local families and taught civilians how to stay safe. Artists, cooks and traders pitched in. The city came alive again not only because of battles won but because people returned to rebuild their lives.

Our goal is simple: push Bajadena’s occupying forces back, free everyone who was taken, and restore Arway. When the dust settles we will rebuild our streets, reopen festivals and bring laughter back to the squares. Clans will be remembered not only for the fights they joined but for the lives they saved and the care they showed afterward. This is our home and we will stand together until Arway is free.
